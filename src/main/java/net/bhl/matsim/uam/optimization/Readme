Steps for optimization of vertiport locations:
1. Prepare the trips file with the following columns: tripID, personID, originX, originY, destinationX, destinationY, departureTime (in seconds), pTravelTime, pTripLength, pInvehicleTime, pWaitingTime, carTravelTime, carTripLength, tripPurpose, carTravelCost, pTravelCost, carUtility, pUtility, UAMUtilityFix (only related to the traveller itself, including income, age,...), carGeneralizedCost, pGeneralizedCost, Income (€/year) # All times are in seconds, all distances are in meters, all costs are in €
2. Prepare the vertiport locations file with the following columns: vertiportID, vertiportX, vertiportY,capacity
3. Run the class "preCalculateAccessEgressCost"
4. Run the classes "VertiportOptimizer..." Note: for VertiportOptimizerGenetic, you need to provide the path for output file in the arguments of the main method as well, it records the fest fitness of each generation.
5. Examples of input file see "examples\OptimizationExamples"
